# Why Type Guards Are Necessary: A Deep dive into TypeScript's Type Safety

In the world of TypeScript , ensuring type safety is one of the biggest advantages it offers over vanilla JavaScript. But as applications grow more complex and you start working with mixed types or union types, it becomes increasingly challenging to manage type-related errors. This is where **type guards** come into play.

## Why Are Type Guards Necessary in TypeScript?

TypeScript is a powerful tool that adds static typing to JavaScript, helping developers catch errors during development before the code runs.
 However, TypeScript's type checking occurs at compile-time, not at runtime. 
 This distinction becomes particularly important when your code interacts with **dynamic data** or involves **union types**  where a variable might have multiple possible types.
**Type Guards** are a way to check what ype a value is while your code iss running. this is important because it helps **prevent errors** and makes your code **safer and easier to read**.

### 1 Handling Multiple Types (Union Types)

sometimes, a variable can be more than one type. For example, it might be a _string_ or a _number_. Type Guard help you check  which type it is **before** you use it. For *example:-*

function printLength(value: string | number){
    if(typeof value === "string"){
        console.log(value.length);
    } else {
        console.log(value);
    };
};


### 2. Preventing Runtime Errors
Sometimes, you work with unknown or mixed data types, Type Guards help you **avoid errors** when accessing properties or methods. For *example:-*

functionn processValue(value: unknown){
    if(typeof value === "string"){
        console.log(value.toUpperCase());
    } else{
        console.log("Not a string");
    };
};

### 3. Easier to REad and Understand

Type Guards make your code cleaner for other developers. It's easier to see what you are  checking for, and it reduces bugs.
